        The T-34 is a Soviet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_tank">medium tank</a> from 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War </a>II.
        When introduced, its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more
        powerful than many of its contemporaries,[8] and its 
        60-degree sloped armour provided good protection against 
        anti-tank weapons. The T-34 had a profound effect on the 
        conflict on the Eastern Front, and had a long-lasting impact
        on tank design. The tank was praised by multiple German 
        generals when encountered during Operation Barbarossa, 
        although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war.
        Its main strength was its cost and production time, 
        meaning that German panzer forces would often fight 
        against Soviet tank forces several times their size. 
        The T-34 is also a critical part of the mechanized divisions th
        at form the backbone of the Deep Battle Strategy.

    <h1>Java Tutorial</h1>
    This Java Tutorial is designed for beginners as well as experienced professionals. Whether youâ€™re starting your Java
    journey and looking to understand the basics of Java or its advanced concepts, this free Java tutorial is the
    perfect resource for you.

    <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. This platform
    independent programming language is utilized for Android development, web development, artificial intelligence,
    cloud applications, and much more.

    In this tutorial, we will cover everything from the basics of Java syntax to advanced topics like object-oriented
    programming and exception handling. So, by the end of this tutorial, you will have a strong understanding of Java
    and be ready to start writing your own Java applications.

    <h1>Features of Java</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.</li>
        <li>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for
            primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
        <li>The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java
            Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.</li>
        <li>Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like
            pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.</li>
        <li>Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop
            applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.</li>
        <li>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things
            which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always
            references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass
            references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.
        </li>
        <li>When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java
            typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type
            checking, but Python does not.</li>
    </ul>
